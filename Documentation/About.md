About
=====

This app was developed to produce estimates of exposure dates for Ebola
cases. It can also produce estimates of the date that symptoms developed
if we have information on symptoms or date of death.

Authors:

-   Mary Choi developed the calculator logic.

-   Katy Gaythorpe developed the app.

-   Aaron Morris developed the cluster analysis.

-   Miles Stewart developed the VHF app version.

Feedback and requests for the app should be sent to k.gaythorpe AT
