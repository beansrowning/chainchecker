About
=====

This app was developed to produce estimates of exposure dates for Ebola
cases. It can also produce estimates of the date that symptoms developed
if we have information on symptoms or date of death.

Authors:

-   Katy Gaythorpe developed the app.

-   Aaron Morris developed the cluster analysis.

-   Mary Choi developed the calculator logic.

-   Miles Stewart developed the VHF app version.

-   Mara Kont helped with the translation.

Feedback and requests for the app should be sent to k.gaythorpe AT
imperial.ac.uk or aaron.morris10 AT imperial.ac.uk
